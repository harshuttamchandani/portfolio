    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm a third-year B.Tech student in Computer Science Engineering at VIT Bhopal, with a growing passion for full-stack development and data structures. My journey in the world of coding began in class 6, where I first encountered the joys of programming through creating a game in the SiMPLE language. This early exploration led to further learning in QBASIC and participation in Google Code-in, culminating in my advanced understanding of C++ during my senior school years.</p>

    <p>Currently, I am deepening my expertise in full-stack development, constantly seeking to blend theoretical knowledge with practical application. My academic path hasn't been without its challenges; a diagnosis of an autoimmune disorder in my second year tested my resilience but also strengthened my determination. Despite these hurdles, I've continued to code and grow, using each line of code as a step towards a more skilled and adaptable future in the tech world.</p>

    <p>I'm always open to connecting with like-minded individuals and professionals who share a passion for technology and overcoming challenges.</p>

    <h2>My MOGAD Story</h2>
    <p>Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) is a glycoprotein believed to be important in the myelination of nerves in the central nervous system (CNS). In humans this protein is encoded by the MOG gene. It is speculated to serve as a necessary "adhesion molecule" to provide structural integrity to the myelin sheath and is known to develop late on the oligodendrocyte.</p>

    <p>While the primary molecular function of MOG is not yet known, its likely role with the myelin sheath is either in sheath "completion and/or maintenance". MOG's cDNA coding region in humans have been shown to be "highly homologous" to rats, mice, and bovine, and hence highly conserved. This suggests "an important biological role for this protein".</p>

    <h3>Timeline of My Journey</h3>
